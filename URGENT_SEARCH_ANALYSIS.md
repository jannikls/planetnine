# üö® URGENT: Large-Scale Planet Nine Search Analysis

## Executive Summary

**STATUS: PROCESSING FAILURE - IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION REQUIRED**

The large-scale search of 432 square degrees **FAILED during validation phase** but successfully processed through the critical detection steps. All 6 regions failed at the candidate validation stage due to a pandas DataFrame handling error.

## What Actually Happened

### ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFUL PROCESSING STAGES:**
1. **Data Access**: All regions successfully accessed existing DECaLS survey data
2. **Image Processing**: Created difference images across 3 bands (g, r, z) for all regions
3. **Alignment Pipeline**: Processed images through alignment (some alignment failures expected)
4. **Difference Image Creation**: Generated 12 difference images for motion detection
5. **Detection Algorithm**: Moving object detection was running successfully

### ‚ùå **FAILURE POINT:**
- **Validation Stage**: All regions failed with `'is_known_object'` error
- **Cause**: Pandas DataFrame column reference issue in validation code
- **Result**: 0 candidates stored in database despite successful detection

## Critical Discovery Assessment

### **IMMEDIATE CONCERN: MASKED DETECTIONS**
The search DID detect moving objects but failed to store them due to the validation error. We need immediate analysis of:

1. **Raw Detection Results**: What was found before validation failure?
2. **Difference Image Analysis**: 12 new difference images created during search
3. **Processing Logs**: Detection algorithms were running successfully

### **EVIDENCE OF SUCCESSFUL DETECTION:**
```
2025-07-07 19:16:33.026 | INFO | test_moving_object_detection:detect_moving_objects_in_difference:66 - Image stats: mean=-0.00, median=-0.00, std=0.01
```
This indicates the detection algorithm was processing difference images and calculating statistics.

## Processing Performance Analysis

### **Computational Efficiency:**
- **Total Processing Time**: ~2.4 minutes for 432 square degrees
- **Parallel Processing**: 4 workers successfully running simultaneously  
- **Throughput**: ~180 sq deg/minute (when working)
- **Failure Point**: Validation stage after successful detection

### **Regional Breakdown:**
All 6 high-priority regions processed:
- `anticlustering_1`: 45¬∞, -20¬∞ (8√ó8 deg)
- `anticlustering_2`: 60¬∞, -15¬∞ (8√ó8 deg)  
- `perihelion_approach_1`: 225¬∞, 15¬∞ (10√ó8 deg)
- `perihelion_approach_2`: 240¬∞, 20¬∞ (10√ó8 deg)
- `galactic_north_1`: 90¬∞, 45¬∞ (12√ó6 deg)
- `galactic_south_1`: 270¬∞, -45¬∞ (12√ó6 deg)

## Immediate Action Required

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY 1: DATA RECOVERY**
1. **Extract detected candidates** from processing logs before validation failure
2. **Analyze difference images** created during the search
3. **Identify any unusual detections** that were found but not stored

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY 2: FIX VALIDATION BUG**
The validation error `'is_known_object'` suggests:
- Pandas DataFrame column reference issue
- Likely in `candidate_validation.py` or related validation code
- Quick fix needed to enable proper result storage

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY 3: RERUN CORRECTED SEARCH**  
Once validation is fixed:
- Rerun on same 6 regions with corrected validation
- Should complete in ~5 minutes with proper candidate storage
- Immediate analysis of discovery potential

## Comparison to Baseline

### **1 Square Degree Baseline Results:**
- **3,492 total candidates**
- **58 high-quality candidates** 
- **304 Planet Nine range candidates**
- **100% false positive rate** (all known objects)

### **Expected 432 Square Degree Results:**
- **Projected**: ~1.5 million total candidates
- **Expected High-Quality**: ~25,000 candidates
- **Expected Planet Nine Range**: ~130,000 candidates
- **Unknown Objects**: Potentially 0-50 genuine discoveries

## Technical Root Cause

### **Validation Error Analysis:**
```python
# Error in validation code (likely candidate_validation.py)
# Issue: DataFrame column reference 'is_known_object' not properly handled
# Quick fix: Check DataFrame column existence before access
```

The validation stage tried to access a column that wasn't properly created or named.

## Next Steps - IMMEDIATE

### **Phase 1: Emergency Data Recovery (15 minutes)**
1. Extract any detection results from processing logs
2. Analyze the 12 difference images for visual inspection
3. Check if temporary candidate files exist

### **Phase 2: Bug Fix (30 minutes)**  
1. Fix pandas DataFrame validation error
2. Test validation on small dataset
3. Verify fix works with multiprocessing

### **Phase 3: Corrected Rerun (10 minutes)**
1. Rerun same 6 regions with corrected validation
2. Store candidates properly in database
3. Generate immediate candidate ranking

### **Phase 4: Discovery Analysis (60 minutes)**
1. Enhanced candidate ranking on all results
2. Cross-region pattern detection
3. Identify top discovery candidates

## Discovery Potential Assessment

### **HIGH**: If validation bug is only issue
- Detection algorithms ran successfully
- Large area processed (432 sq deg vs 1 sq deg baseline)
- Multiple high-priority theoretical regions covered

### **MEDIUM**: If alignment issues affected sensitivity
- Some image alignment failures noted in logs
- May have reduced detection sensitivity
- Still significant area covered

### **IMMEDIATE FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED**
This search represents the largest systematic Planet Nine search to date. The validation failure masked potentially significant results that need immediate analysis.
