# Planet Nine Detection System - Validation Summary

## Test Results Overview

### ✅ Successful Components

1. **Project Infrastructure**
   - Successfully set up modular directory structure
   - Dependencies installed and working
   - Configuration system operational
   - Logging system functioning properly

2. **Theoretical Orbital Mechanics** 
   - REBOUND integration working correctly
   - Orbital calculations producing results
   - Probability map generation successful
   - Monte Carlo sampling operational

3. **Code Architecture**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Modular design ready for expansion
   - Error handling in place

### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Data Download Problems**
   - DECaLS cutout service returning "no such layer" error
   - Downloaded FITS files are invalid (only 13 bytes)
   - Need to update DECaLS URLs or use different data access method
   - WISE download has format issues with catalog columns

2. **Orbital Mechanics Calibration**
   - Proper motion calculations showing values too high (100-2300 arcsec/year)
   - Expected range is 0.2-0.8 arcsec/year for Planet Nine
   - This suggests:
     - Need to verify orbital element initialization
     - May need to sample mean anomaly better to avoid clustering at perihelion
     - Distance distribution looks reasonable (100-600 AU)

3. **Missing Components for Phase 2**
   - Need working survey data before implementing image processing
   - Cannot test TNO recovery without valid images

## Key Findings from Probability Map

The probability distribution shows:
- Wide spread in RA (0-360°) as expected
- Declination concentrated around ±20° matching theoretical inclination
- Distance distribution peaks around 300 AU (reasonable)
- Proper motion distribution is problematic (too high)

## Recommendations Before Phase 2

1. **Fix Data Access** (Critical)
   - Update DECaLS URLs to use their new API
   - Consider using astroquery.legacysurvey module
   - Implement fallback to other surveys if needed

2. **Calibrate Orbital Mechanics**
   - Fix proper motion calculation 
   - Ensure we're sampling full orbit, not just perihelion
   - Validate against known TNO orbits

3. **Add Data Validation**
   - Check file sizes before assuming download success
   - Validate FITS headers
   - Implement retry logic for failed downloads

## Next Steps

1. Fix the data download issues first
2. Recalibrate the orbital mechanics
3. Once we have valid data, proceed with Phase 2 image processing

The foundation is solid, but we need working data before moving forward.
